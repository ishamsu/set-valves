Hey, I'm **Shamsudheen** 👋

I’m building some really cool products under the [heedlabs](https://heedlabs.com/) umbrella.

I started working at the [Makergram](https://makergram.com/community/) community in 2019 as an intern, fueled by my love for building. Now, as a software engineer, I get to help others create amazing things.

When I’m not coding, I’m out [trekking](https://www.instagram.com/ishamsu_) ⛺ searching for [big cats](https://shamsu.co/photos/wild-finds.md) 🐯 to befriend (still no luck!).
